        quote: "I was fortunate enough to work with Joseph from the start of my career in online ecommerce. Joe is an exceptional software engineer who possesses many skills. In my time working with Joe we were able to create and successfully execute many first time projects such as dynamic footwear finders, event live streams, and personalization. Joe has a wealth of knowledge and continuously informed cross functional teams of the possibilities and options throughout various projects. He always explained the 'why' behind his suggestions and provided alternative solutions. Joe is someone you can count on to think outside of the box and to see a project though to the end. You can be confident that Joe will always make decisions that will benefit the company, job, and team he is working on. He is an exceptional team member and someone I would gladly work with again.",
